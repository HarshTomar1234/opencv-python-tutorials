# OpenCV-Python Tutorials

Welcome to a comprehensive guide on getting started with OpenCV-Python! This repository contains detailed tutorials, scripts, and documentation to help you learn computer vision using OpenCV with Python.

## What is OpenCV?

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products. It has more than 2500 optimized algorithms for real-time computer vision tasks.

## Repository Structure

Each tutorial topic has:
1. A Python script (`.py`) demonstrating the concepts
2. A detailed Markdown (`.md`) file explaining the theory and code

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Basic knowledge of image processing concepts (helpful but not required)

## Installation

```bash
# Install OpenCV-Python
pip install opencv-python

# For additional modules (optional)
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
